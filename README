ThunderVision Project is a Final Year Project with the intend to
estimate depth from stereo pair of cameras, using CUDA to make it faster.

It's implements Semi-global matching with Birchfield & Tomasi cost.

Although it's main objective was to be fast, OpenCV CPU implementation is 
currently faster. But we think that we can outperform OpenCV, allot of
GPU optimization techniques still were not used in this project.

TODO:
Documentation on source code.
User documentation.
Windows and MAC OS X ports. Should not be hard.
Make it faster and better. :)
